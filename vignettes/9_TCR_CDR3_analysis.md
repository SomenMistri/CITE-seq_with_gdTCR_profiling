# TCR CDR3 clonotype analysis

This repository provides an R Notebook guiding through the analysis of paired or unpaired CDR3γ and CDR3δ analysis using R.

There are five R notebooks with distinct final output: 
1. 9.1_clonotype_abundance_list.Rmd
2. 9.2_CDR3γ_or_CDR3δ_amino_aa_length_distribution.Rmd
3. 9.3_clonotype_abundance_bubbleplot.Rmd
4. 9.4_clonotype_abundance_dotplot.Rmd
5. 9.5_clonotype_diversity_scRepertoire.Rmd

## R Notebook: 9.1_clonotype_abundance_list: 
Click [here](/R_notebooks/9.1_clonotype_abundance_list.Rmd) to access the R notebook. The the output of this R script is one excel file that lists all the clonotypes (paired CDR3γ and CDR3δ) from WT and KO samples as well as individual biological replicates. The clonotypes are arranged in decreasing counts. The output looks like the following with each sample as a separate tab/sheet in the excel file:
